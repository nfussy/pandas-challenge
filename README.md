# pandas-challenge

**Background**
In this challenge, I used jupyter notebook to analyze the data from both data sets. 

Collaboration with others:
> Spoke with Conner Dekok about the variables used and adopted some of his code to hide/remove rows from the dataframe. Also with Hunter Becker, I believe his name is.
> "per_school_summary.index.name = None" will remove the extra row at the top of the dataframe, cleaning it up visually.
> Conner and I worked separately for the most part, and all of our results were the same. These matched the ones from the provided sample code.

Citations:

> Much of the code was already provided to us in the classroom challenges.

**All other lines of code were generated from what we learned in class**
